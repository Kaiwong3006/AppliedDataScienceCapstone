The city council has recently made a pledge to try and reduce the number of injury collisions in their city after a high-profile case involving a kid getting injured made national news.  To do this, they pulled up collision data to see which factors (if any) can predict if an accident will be property damage or an injury collision.  
They want to see what factors have significant correlation with SEVERITYCODE, and from there try to come up with specific solutions (such as improved streetlights or fixing certain intersections) that will reduce the overall number of injury collisions.
